  Box Alpha:
  The researchers fed female pigs dried cranberry powder, collected their urine and used chromatography to separate it into fractions of differently sized molecules. Then, they screened the samples for anti-adhesion activity against the E. coli bacteria that cause UTIs. To the researchers’ surprise, proanthocyanidins, the compounds previously proposed to be responsible for cranberry’s apparent UTI prevention properties, were absent from the active urine fractions. Instead, the researchers detected oligosaccharides called arabinoxyloglucans in those samples. These complex carbohydrates, related to cellulose, are difficult to detect and isolate, which could explain why they hadn't previously been identified as anti-adhesive components of cranberry, the researchers say.

  Box 2 Beta:
  In the open-label study, 24 people (mean age 35.5 years) were randomized to one of four commercially available sunscreens (two sprays, one lotion, or one cream formulation); 2 mg of sunscreen per 1 cm2 was applied to 75% of their body surface four times a day for 4 days (described as “maximal use conditions consistent with current sunscreen labeling”), and 30 blood samples were collected over 7 days.

  The primary outcome was the maximum plasma concentration of avobenzone, from days 1-7; secondary outcomes were maximum plasma concentrations of sunscreen ingredients oxybenzone, octocrylene, and ecamsule over the same period of time.

  All but one participant completed the study. “All four sunscreen active ingredients tested resulted in exposures exceeding 0.5 ng/mL,” reported Murali Matta, PhD, of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, and coauthors. “The clinical effect of plasma concentrations exceeding 0.5 ng/mL is unknown, necessitating further research,” they added.

  Box 3 Gamma:
  Isabelle Carnell-Holdaway is a British teenager with cystic fibrosis. When she was 15, Isabelle underwent a lung transplant at Great Ormond Street Hospital, and whilst recovering, developed a life-threatening, multi-drug resistant infection.

  Realizing that antibiotics were not going to work, doctors decided to try an experimental treatment in the form of genetically engineered viruses (known as bacteriophages) that infect and kill bacteria. The treatment was highly successful, and the details of the case study were published in the latest issue of the journal Nature Medicine.
